> Create a settings file from a Sass codebase

[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/zurb/octophant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zurb/octophant) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/paint-by-number.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/octophant)

Once banished to ZURB's *Creatures of Nightmare* as a freakish outcast, the Octophant has found its calling as a file generator. Nimble and flexible, the Octophant uses its many trunks to gather a framework's many Sass variables, aggregating them into one file.

We make use of the Octophant's talents at ZURB with the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) family of front-end frameworks, to automatically generate settings files.

## Installation

```bash
npm install octophant
```

## Usage

Variables are parsed using SassDoc, which means any variable you want to be found must be documented with a comment that has three slashes.

```scss
/// This variable will be found by the parser.
$primary-color: blue;

// This one won't.
$private-value: 10px;
```

Variables are grouped by component. The component is defined by the `@group` a variable belongs to. The group can be set on individual variables, or on every variable in a file using a poster comment.

When writing the file, Octophant automatically converts hyphens in group names to spaces, and then capitalizes each word. So `menu-bar` becomes `Menu Bar`. You can also define custom names for each group with the `groups` option.

```scss
////
/// @group button
////

/// Button background
$button-background: blue;

/// Button color
$button-color: white;
```

## API

### octophant(files [, options, cb])

Parses a set of files and creates a new SCSS file with all of the collected variables in one place. This value is passed directly to the SassDoc parser, which accepts a directory name, or a glob pattern of files.

#### files

**Type:** `Array` or `String`

One or more [globs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) to parse. Every annotated Sass variable found in these files will be included in the final settings file.

#### options

**Type:** `Object`

- `title` (`String`): Title to print at the top of the file.
- `output` (`String`): Path relative to the CWD to output the settings file to.
- `groups` (`Object`): A set of key/value pairs for the sections of the settings file. Each key is a SassDoc group, and the value is an expanded name.
- `imports` (`Array`): A series of strings which represent Sass libraries to import. These libraries are added as `@import` statements before the first section.
- `sort` (`Array`): A series of strings which represent sections that should be floated to the top. You don't need to define every group here; groups left out of `sort` will remain alphabetical.

#### cb

**Type:** `Function`

Callback to run when the file has been written to disk.
